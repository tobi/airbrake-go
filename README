airbrake.Notify(err) reports an error

airbrake.Error(err, *http.Request) can be used to add more context if you are in a http context


You can also automatically have this library report panics, use this method:

airbrake.CapturePanic(*http.Request)


example:

  func serve(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
      defer airbrake.CapturePanic(r)
      
      [...]

      panic("Oh no :-(") // will be recorded by airbrake 

  }
